            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
              By accessing and using the Elite Floors website and services, you accept and
              agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of this agreement. If you do not
              agree to abide by these terms, please do not use this website or services.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Services Description</h2>
            <p>
              Elite Floors is an online platform that assists homeowners in connecting with
              independent residential flooring service providers. Services may include, but
              are not limited to, solid hardwood flooring installation, sand and finish
              services, staircase work, engineered wood, laminate, vinyl flooring, carpet
              installation, tile and natural stone flooring, and countertop surface
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              All services are subject to availability and may vary based on location,
              project scope, contractor availability, and other factors.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Estimates and Pricing</h2>
            <p>
              We offer free estimates for potential flooring projects. Estimates are based
              on information provided during consultations and may change due to site
              conditions, changes in project scope, unforeseen complications, material
              availability, or pricing fluctuations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Final pricing, scope of work, and payment terms will be confirmed in writing
              between the homeowner and the selected independent service provider prior to
              the start of any work. All prices are stated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise
              specified.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>
              Elite Floors does not process payments on behalf of contractors unless
              explicitly stated. Payment terms, including deposits, progress payments, and
              final payments, are determined by the independent service provider and outlined
              in the project agreement between the homeowner and the contractor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elite Floors is not responsible for payment disputes between homeowners and
              service providers.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Project Timeline</h2>
            <p>
              Project timelines are estimates only and may be affected by factors including
              material availability, weather conditions, permit requirements, unforeseen site
              conditions, or changes requested by the homeowner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Independent service providers are responsible for communicating timelines and
              any delays directly to the homeowner.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Warranties</h2>
            <p>
              Any warranties related to workmanship or materials are provided solely by the
              independent service provider or manufacturer, as outlined in the written
              agreement between the homeowner and the contractor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elite Floors does not provide warranties and does not guarantee the quality,
              performance, or results of any work performed by independent service providers.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Client Responsibilities</h2>

              any damages arising from services performed by independent contractors. Elite
              Floors’ liability, if any, is limited to the use of the website platform
